# GL-Tetris
 SDL + OpenGL Port

# History
Original Code was written by Daniel Peschman in 2001 while attending UAT.  It was only builty for windos, using DirectX for Input/Sound and OpenGL for rendering.  

# Legacy
Cross Platform gaming is important to me and Dan allowed me to have his original code and granted me access to publish to github.  I am learning OpenGL with this port.
